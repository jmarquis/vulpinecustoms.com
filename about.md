# About

We build GameCube controllers for Smash competitors and enthusiasts. Every controller we sell is modded and tested to the highest possible standards for the ultimate high-quality feel and long-term consistent performance, and usually features a minimalist bespoke design incorporating custom handmade components from various talented members of the GCC modder community.

Small batches of premade controllers drop regularly on <a href="https://vulpinecustoms.etsy.com" target="_blank">Etsy</a> and are announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/VulpineCustoms" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Premades often sell out quickly, so make sure you’re following us on Twitter to be the first to know when there’s a drop.

Commissions are very selectively accepted. Send us a message on Twitter or Etsy to inquire.
