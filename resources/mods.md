# GCC mod guide

This is a list of common GameCube controller mods (including prices, if it’s something that Vulpine offers).

## Included with every Vulpine controller

### Anti-snapback module

A set of adjustable capacitors attached to the X and Y terminals of the left analog stick, designed to suppress unintentional inputs resulting from the stick snapping back to center. Commonly seen as a must-have for competitive Smash in the modern era. Each Vulpine controller comes with a module that is carefully calibrated to that specific controller to ensure the player will never experience snapback.

Note that a snapback module is not necessary for PhobGCC controllers (see below).

### Custom stickbox springs

There are several aftermarket options for replacement stickbox springs that change the feel of the analog stick movement. The most popular of these was coined the [“Slickbox”](https://firescc.com/fires-slickbox){:target=>'blank'} by GCC modding pioneer FIRES. These wavedisc springs result in a lighter, smoother, and more linear stick tension, comparable to a nicely broken-in analog stick but with no dead zone or wobble. Linear tension means that, unlike the stock stickbox springs, the same amount of tension is applied on the stick no matter how far from center it moves.

There are also three sizes of shim to choose from, which changes the weight of the tension:

- **0.03"** — Heaviest weighting. Similar to OEM but linear. Used by default on Vulpine controllers since it has the most familiar feel to someone who has used stock controllers.
- **0.025"** — Light weighting. Good for rapid analog inputs, but takes a bit of getting used to.
- **0.02"** — “Feather” weighting. Choose this at your own peril.

### Stabilized buttons and triggers

Stock GCC buttons and triggers do not fit snugly in the shell, resulting in a significant amount of wobbling and sometimes scraping when pressed. Resin parts are typically even smaller due to shrinkage, exacerbating this effect. To fix this, commercial-grade low-friction Teflon PTFE tape is carefully added to each button chamber and trigger opening to reduce the amount of play and give the button/trigger a nice slick surface to rub against, resulting in much crisper button presses and more stable trigger pulls.

### Trigger and stickbox lube

Triggers and stickboxes are the two highest-friction parts of a GCC. Applying an appropriate long-lasting grease to the internals of each of them results in buttery-smooth movement. For triggers, Krytox 205g0 is commonly recommended, and for stickboxes the most popular options are Molykote 44 and Krytox 215.

### Tactile Z

“Tactile Z” has been used to describe many mods related to the Z button and its underlying switch, but generally it refers to replacing the switch under the button with a higher-actuation one that has more of a “clicky” feel. Vulpine offers the following switches, and by default we also bend the metal spring/clip attached to the button to reduce the tension needed to press it:

- OEM switch (from Wii Classic Controller)
- 100gf switch
- 150gf switch

Another common option, regardless of switch choice, is to remove the spring entirely and simply let the button rest against the switch.

## Optional upgrades

### PhobGCC: +$60

An open-source project to create a custom replacement motherboard for the stock GameCube controller. Upgrading to a Phob board replaces the standard carbon analog stick potentiometers with magnets and Hall effect sensors that never wear down, making PODE a thing of the past. The PhobGCC firmware is also highly configurable and has built-in support for snapback filtering, button swaps (for Z jump), single-motion ledgedash, and more. While many features of the Phob are primarily intended for Melee players, all Smash players can benefit from the consistency of analog inputs inherent to the Hall sensor setup.

### Trigger plugs: +$5 each

One of the oldest GCC mods out there, trigger plugs reduce the amount of travel in a trigger before it bottoms out and activates the digital press. There are two common lengths of trigger plugs, usually referred to as “short” and either “long” or “tall”. A short plug leaves enough travel to activate a small amount of light shield before bottoming out, while a long/tall plug immediately activates the digital press. It is common to detach the trigger from the analog slider when using a long/tall plug to prevent unintentional light shield inputs.

Note that trigger plugs only work for Melee without additional controller modification (or replacing the internals with a Phob board), because Ultimate does not read a digital press as a shield input.

### Softer trigger springs: +$5 each

Several options of replacement trigger springs have been found over the years, usually with the goal of reducing the resistance when pulling the trigger. Vulpine stocks “Rienne springs,” which have slightly lower tension than OEM springs. Another option is to trim and anneal OEM springs to reduce tension.

### Paracord: +$35 (2m) / +$40 (3m)

A very popular aesthetic upgrade, a paracord-wrapped cable (often just called a “paracord”) replaces the rubber casing of the cable with a braided nylon casing. Paracords are typically very durable, but are more often sought-after because they come in hundreds of colors and patterns that can complement a controller’s design. For a Vulpine controller, you can pick any color/pattern you want from [Paracord Planet](https://www.paracordplanet.com/cord-color-chart/){:target=>'blank'} in 6ft or 10ft length.

### Perforated pads: +$10

A common mod to reduce the amount of force needed to press a button or the digital press at the bottom of the trigger pull. This is done by puncturing the base of the silicone button pads with a set of holes or cuts, simulating a substantial amount of wear for a more broken-in feel. Vulpine also stocks softer non-perforated pads for the same price.
