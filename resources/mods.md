# GCC mod guide

This is a directory of common GameCube controller mods (including prices, if it’s something that Vulpine Customs offers).

## Included with every Vulpine controller

### Anti-snapback module

A set of adjustable capacitors attached to the X and Y terminals of the left analog stick, designed to suppress unintentional inputs resulting from the stick snapping back to center. Commonly seen as a must-have for competitive Smash in the modern era. Each Vulpine controller comes with a module that is carefully calibrated to that specific controller to ensure the player will never experience snapback.

Note that a snapback module is not necessary, and therefore not included, for PhobGCC controllers (see below).

### Slickbox

Invented and popularized by GCC modding pioneer FIRES, the [SLICKbox mod](https://firescc.com/fires-slickbox){:target=>'blank'} (as it is originally stylized) replaces the factory stickbox springs with aftermarket wavedisc springs. This results in a lighter, smoother, and more linear stick tension, comparable to a nicely broken-in analog stick but with no dead zone or wobble. There are also three sizes of shim to choose from, which changes the weight of the tension:

- **0.03"** — Heaviest weighting. Similar to OEM but smoother and lighter. Used by default on Vulpine controllers since it has the most familiar feel to someone who has used stock controllers.
- **0.025"** — Light weighting. Good for rapid analog inputs, but takes a bit of getting used to.
- **0.02"** — “Feather” weighting. Choose this at your own peril.

### Stabilized buttons and triggers

Stock GCC buttons and triggers do not fit snugly in the shell, resulting in a significant amount of wobbling and sometimes scraping when pressed. Commercial-grade low-friction Teflon PTFE tape is very carefully added to each button chamber and trigger opening to reduce the amount of play and give the button/trigger a nice slick surface to rub against, resulting in much crisper button presses and more stable trigger pulls.

### Trigger and stickbox lube

Triggers and stickboxes are the two highest-friction parts of a GCC. Applying an appropriate long-lasting grease to the internals of each of them results in buttery-smooth movement. For triggers, Krytox 205g0 is commonly recommended, and for stickboxes the most popular options are Molykote 44 and Krytox 215.

## Optional upgrades

### PhobGCC (+$100)

An open-source project to create a custom replacement motherboard for the stock GameCube controller. Upgrading to a Phob board replaces the standard carbon analog stick potentiometers with magnets and Hall effect sensors that never wear down, making PODE a thing of the past. The PhobGCC firmware is also highly configurable and has built-in support for snapback filtering, button swaps (for Z jump), single-motion ledgedash, and more. While many features of the Phob are primarily intended for Melee players, all Smash players benefit from the consistency of analog inputs inherent to the Hall sensor setup.

### Tactile Z (+$15)

“Tactile Z” has been used to describe many mods related to the Z button and its underlying switch, but generally it refers to replacing the switch under the button with a higher-actuation one that has more of a “clicky” feel. Vulpine Customs offers 100g and 150g force switches, and by default we also bend the metal spring/clip attached to the button to reduce the tension needed to press it. Another common option is to remove the spring entirely and simply let the button rest against the switch.

Note that this is distinct from the “mouseclick Z” mod (see below).

### Trigger plugs (+$5 each)

One of the oldest GCC mods out there, trigger plugs reduce the amount of travel in a trigger before it bottoms out and activates the digital press. There are two common lengths of trigger plugs, usually referred to as “short” and either “long” or “tall”. A short plug leaves enough travel to activate a small amount of light shield before bottoming out, while a long/tall plug immediately activates the digital press. It is common to detach the trigger from the analog slider when using a long/tall plug to prevent unintentional light shield inputs.

Note that trigger plugs only work for Melee without additional controller modification (or replacing the internals with a Phob board), because Ultimate does not read a digital press as a shield input.

### Paracord (+$40)

A very popular aesthetic upgrade, a paracord-wrapped cable (often just called a “paracord”) replaces the rubber casing of the cable with a braided nylon casing. Paracords are typically very durable, but are more often sought-after because they come in hundreds of colors and patterns that can complement a controller’s design. For a Vulpine controller, you can pick any color/pattern you want from [Paracord Planet](https://www.paracordplanet.com/cord-color-chart/){:target=>'blank'} in 6ft or 10ft length.

## Not offered by Vulpine Customs

### Mouseclick buttons/triggers/Z

A newer mod to replace the silicone button/trigger pads and/or Z button switch with “mouseclick” switches, lower-actuation switches with very crisp, audibly-clicky feedback. While popular with some players, there are ongoing reliability problems that prevent Vulpine from being able to confidently offer these at this time.

### Notches

The stock GCC gate around the left analog stick is octogonal, but depending on the character you play in Melee, there are a varying number of angles between these 8 points that may be useful to be able to consistently hit. This is why some players prefer to have additional notches added to their gate. It is worth noting that notches can wear over time and may need to be touched up (or recalibrated, in the case of a Phob) to maintain their intended angular values.

There are a few common sets of notches:
- **Wavedash notches** represent the angles used to get the longest possible wavedash distance.
- **Shield drop notches** (which actually adjust the lower diagonal notches slightly) were originally used to get consistent shield drops, but these have become less popular since UCF became the de facto standard version of the game played competitively.
- **Firefox notches** make it easier to use the full range of angles compatible with Fox’s Firefox and Falco’s Firebird recovery moves.

Vulpine Customs is not currently offering notching.

### Digital triggers

Also called the “digital to analog” mod, the goal of this mod is to make trigger plugs compatible with Ultimate by connecting the trigger’s digital press to the analog input, which involves a certain amount of complexity. Consider opting for the Phob upgrade instead, since the Phob has a built-in software solution for this along with many other benefits.

### Perforated pads

A common mod to reduce the amount of force needed to press a button or the digital press at the bottom of the trigger pull. This is done by puncturing the base of the silicone button pads with a set of holes or cuts, simulating a substantial amount of wear for a more broken-in feel. While this mod is generally seen as safe if done carefully, it can significantly reduce the lifespan of the button pads and introduces the chances of sudden pad failure. Vulpine Customs stocks more gently worn-in pads as an alternative that can be used in a controller upon request.
